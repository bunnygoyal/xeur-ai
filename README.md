## The Problem: The Technical Barrier Trap

The gaming industry faces a structural market failure:
- **6% Completion Rate**: Only 6% of game ideas ever become finished games
- **Technical Expertise Chasm**: Game creation requires mastery of coding, 3D modeling, animation, physics, and more
- **Resource Drain**: Average cost of $300K+ per game and 6+ months (often years) of development
- **$142B Annual Lost Opportunity**: The market value of unfinished games
- **3:1 Developer Shortage**: Game developer demand far exceeds supply
