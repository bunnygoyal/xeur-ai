    <tr>
      <td>Low Completion Rate</td>
      <td>Only 6% of game ideas become finished games</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Technical Barrier</td>
      <td>8+ technical disciplines required (coding, 3D modeling, animation, etc.)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Resource Requirements</td>
      <td>$300K+ average cost, 6+ months development time</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Lost Opportunity Size</td>
      <td>$142B annual market value of unfinished games</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Talent Shortage</td>
      <td>3:1 developer demand vs. supply ratio</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
